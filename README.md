# Geometry Smash
 My recreation of Geometry Dash in MonoGame

 Note that I do not own the rights to Geometry Dash or am affiliated with RobTop Games in any way. I am just making this for fun and for learning MonoGame

 **How to Download**
 - Go to releases
 - Get the right version for you Operating System (Linux probably doesn't work)
 - unzip the .zip file
 - in the Geometry_Smash
 - find the Apphost.exe file and double click it
 - It should hopefully start now
